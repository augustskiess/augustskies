Yes, everything hurts. And I've been trying to hide it, by going all dark, but fine, here's your response - everything hurts. I lost everything. I didn't just lose a boyfriend, I lost a family too, one that I foolishly rejected, but one I wish I hadn't now. I took you all for granted. I took you for granted too. I've been trying to make up for my mistakes.
<br><br>
I know that I hurt you too. And I think you want to hurt me, which is fair. The blocking, the notes, I think they were lashing out. Because the truth is that though you may not love me anymore, it was there, and losing that really does hurt someone. It doesn't just go away, even if you do meet someone else soon after.
<br><br>
I want to make it up to you. I don't want to be just a bad memory in your head. I don't want to be just another ex, like the ones you had before, who you understandably can't forgive. Because I also didn't just lose a family. I lost my bestest friend in the entire world, and the only person who understands me, and accepted me.
<br><br>
I got anxious about the future, and about where my life was headed, and I took it out on you. That's why I said those things on the phone call. But you leaving me made me realise the things I wanted in life. Its not fame, or money, but its to be loved for who I am, even just by one person - and *truly* loved. And that's what we had, and I let it go. But even if I broke every other promise, this one I won't break - that I will truly regret it forever. It shouldn't have taken you leaving me for to realise that.
<br><br>
I also want to say that, even though there is no excusing what I did, that the way I am is not entirely my fault. You know about my family, and the insane pressures pressures put on me as a kid. I've learnt that that is where my mindset came from, that's why I viewed things in a certain way, and it really fucked me up. Going to boarding school, with no support either, also really fucked with me. Like smoking for example, I didn't hate smoking or such as like an inherently terrible thing, I viewed it as a gateway to being trapped in the working class. And I didn't want to be trapped in the working class, because I didn't want to end up like my parents, whom I hated. Same with drugs, even weed, which is doesn't even have any negative side effects, and now I'm pro legalislation of that sort of thing. I realised that it doesn't matter what your station is in life, as long as you're surrounded by people you care about. But now I let you go, and I genuinely have nothing. I ended up spending Christmas alone, and I lived in that house alone for weeks. I almost destroyed myself because my eating got so bad, and my sleep schedule got so fucked up. So, while I'm still totally to blame for what happened, its not because I'm a bad person, but I am insanely unlucky. I had to improve before just to be good enough to date you in the first place - can't I improve again?
<br><br>
So please, I ask - leave the door open. Even if not right now, or even if not ever, but just knowing that I could be forgiven, even if that doesn't mean being apart of your life, would really help me. I know its a selfish request. I can't live with what I've done, but I don't think I'm an inherently terrible person. I *can* change, and truly, even if I lied before about changing when we were together, I'm not now. I *have* changed, and there's more work still to do. I've let go of so much hate, towards all the stupid things that we used to disagree on, like the privacy shit, to people worse off than me, who I hated because I didn't want to be that. But I see it now, as I should've before, that the world just isn't kind to everyone. And even to my family, who, of course I'm still never going to see again - but I don't hate them.
<br><br>
I know that you need to move on too. And I know that blocking me is probably apart of that. But you didn't block me everywhere, so I think part of you wants me to see. Can I just have a sign that you don't hate me? Just anything. I've lost so much, and just the thought of being some unlovable, unforgiveable entity is just too much for me. I know you had to tell me what I wanted to hear last time I saw you, that's why you lied. So that's why I'm putting this on this website, so that there's zero pressure for you to respond if I sent you a direct message. So please, if you don't hate me - just any sort of sign would really help me be able to move on and grow and be better.
<br><br>
I miss you<br>
